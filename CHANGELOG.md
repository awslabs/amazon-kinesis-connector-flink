## Release 1.1.0 (December 22nd, 2020)

higher TPS quota, resulting in reduced startup time for high parallelism sources. You may need add IAM permission for 
`kinesis:DescribeStreamSummary` while upgrading to this version

  ([pull request](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-connector-flink/pull/5))

## Release 1.0.2 (October 30th, 2020)
* Ignore `ReadTimeoutException` from `SubcribeToShard` retry policy to prevent app restarting due to high backpressure
  ([pull request](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-connector-flink/pull/3))
